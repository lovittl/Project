##Introduction
	#Hello, I'm Roy Lovitt with the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University 
	#I am currently studying C#, SQL Server, ASP.NET as well as other Cloud Application Developer technologies

##Project
	#My Capstone Project is going to be a Media Player for local MP3 type music files. 
	#The database for the application will include tables to house the Songs, Albums, Playlists, ExportPackages, and Users.
	#The application will include the ability of users to select music by artist, song, genre, year, and album.  

	#Users will also be able to create packages and playlists that can be burned to CD or copied to storage devices for portability.  

##Stretch goals 
	#Include the ability to view history and select favorites.  

##Additional future enhancements 
	#May include a randomizer that would allow the program to select random songs the user has listened to frequently or are like 
	#songs that the user prefers to listen to.
